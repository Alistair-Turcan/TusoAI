## How to use TusoAI

### Installation

Download and unzip this directory. run_tusoai.ipynb is the main starting point of running TusoAI, see details in further sections below.

TusoAI requires only 4 base packages, listed in requirements.txt, which can be installed with the following.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

TusoAI does not install further packages while running. However, it may propose using further packages while optimizing. It is usually beneficial to have an environment set up with many useful packages beforehand, so if TusoAI proposes an optimization that requires a package, it is able to implement this. This can vary by domain, e.g., a single-cell researcher will have many single-cell packages installed, or an ML practicioner will have many ML packages installed. A general purpose environment which has many useful ML packages installed beforehand is the aideml package (https://github.com/WecoAI/aideml/tree/main). This can be installed as below:

```bash
pip install -U aideml
```
